A collection of data structures written in JavaScript. Each data structure is enclosed in its own file, wrapped in a [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][1] API to make it easier to use across multiple platforms.

To learn more about how each data structure is implemented have a look at the [technical articles on my blog][2].
